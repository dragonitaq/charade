# CHARADES GO

This is a web app game for charades party game. It is built using MERN stack technologies.

This is for my portfolio & interest purposes. Thus, I will not implement the feature for user to sigup/login and create their own custom categories. It's because that feature requires time to maintain the cleanliness of those user-created categories content for family friendliness.

I will create & update categories content all by myself for the moment.

Technologies involved:

- react
- react-redux
- react-router-dom
- redux
- redux-logger
- redux-thunk
- reselect
- node.js
- express
- MongoDB (mongoose)
- sass
- axios
- dotenv
- validator
- compression
- cors
- concurrently
- [textFit.js](https://github.com/STRML/textFit)
- ScrollToTop (Official implementation from Redux Router)
